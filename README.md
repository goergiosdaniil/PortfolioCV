The creation of my personal website to deploy all my aspects.
7/08/22
My first attempt to create a personal website. My plan for this website is to showcase all the aspects of my personal and my work life. 
I have already decided to create it using Node.js. Simultaneously I want to make it mobile friendly and create multiple user rights.
For the first day I will just create the server instance and I will deploy Node.js.
